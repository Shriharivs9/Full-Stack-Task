Task Management System

Project Overview

The Task Management System is a full-stack web application built using modern frontend and backend technologies. It enables users to manage tasks efficiently, offering role-based access, real-time updates, and an intuitive user interface. Admins can create, assign, and monitor tasks, while users can update task statuses and add comments.

Features

Frontend

Built with React.

State management using Redux or Zustand.

Responsive and accessible UI design.

Role-based access:

Admin: Can create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as assign tasks to users.

User: Can view their tasks, update task status, and add comments.

Real-time updates for task statuses and comments.

Backend

Built with Python Flask/FastAPI or Node.js with Express.

RESTful API with the following endpoints:

User Authentication (JWT-based).

Task CRUD operations.

Add comments to tasks.

WebSocket integration for real-time updates.

Input validation and error handling.

Database

Configurable to use PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

Data Models:

Users: Manage user information and roles.

Tasks: Track task details, status, and assignment.

Comments: Store task-related comments.

Deployment

Fully deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).

Technologies Used

Frontend

React

Redux or Zustand

TailwindCSS (optional for styling)

Backend

Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)

WebSocket library (e.g., Socket.IO)

Database

PostgreSQL/MySQL (Relational DB) or MongoDB (NoSQL DB)

Other Tools

JWT for authentication

Testing: Pytest (Flask/FastAPI) or Jest (Node.js)

Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)

Python (if using Flask/FastAPI)

Docker (optional for containerization)

PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB

Backend Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system/backend

Install dependencies:

For Node.js:

npm install

For Python:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure the environment variables:

Create a .env file and set the following:

DATABASE_URL=<database_connection_url>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

Start the backend server:

For Node.js:

npm start

For Python:

python app.py

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file and set the following:

REACT_APP_API_URL=<backend_api_url>

Start the development server:

npm start

Database Setup

Create the necessary database schema.

Run migrations or use an ORM to set up tables/collections.

Running Tests

Backend tests:

npm test  # for Node.js
pytest    # for Flask/FastAPI

Frontend tests:

npm test

API Endpoints

Authentication

POST /api/auth/login - User login

POST /api/auth/register - User registration

Tasks

GET /api/tasks - Fetch tasks

POST /api/tasks - Create a new task

PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task details

DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete a task

Comments

GET /api/tasks/:taskId/comments - Fetch comments for a task

Deployment

Deploy the backend and frontend to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).

Ensure the database is hosted on a reliable service (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas).

Update the frontend API URL to match the deployed backend.
